Typescript is a great tool to help Javascript developers create clean, robust and stable code. However, I found it annoying sometimes, especially when I needed my jobs done fast, but didn't know how to fix TypeError. And that gave me a feeling like I have just headed myself into wall-bricks but didn't break through it ðŸ˜Ž.

I hope you wonâ€™t stumble into a wall anyway. Here are some tips about Typescript Iâ€™d love to share with you.

## any,  unknown, never

`any` type was added to Typescript first, later on v2 and v3 of Typescript respectively `unknown` type and `never` type were  introduced. Personally, I found their names confused, so donâ€™t read them, here are how I recognize them:

 - When I want my value to be free of type-checking, I will use any
 - When I donâ€™t know exactly the type of my value, and my value can be any possible value: string, number, objectâ€¦ or union typesâ€¦ I will use unknown
 - I use never type in conditional type to narrow results, and it can say like that will never happen (No value can be assignable to variables of never type)

```Typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;
```
